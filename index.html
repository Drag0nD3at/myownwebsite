        <h1>Welcome to the Lore of Warhammer 40K Space Marines</h1>
        <!-- My plan is to do lore on Warhammer 40K Space Marine Chapters -->
    </main>
    <p>Space Marines, also known as the Adeptus Astartes, are the elite warriors of the Imperium of Man. Space Marines are a fascinating creation. Genetically modified around the age of 10, Space Marines go through many surgeries and augmentation to become the beasts they are. </p>

    <p>Before we can go more into what makes a Space Marine, we must first talk about the Primarchs. The fathers of the Space Marines.</p>

    <h2>The Primarchs</h2>
    <p>The Primarchs were created by the Emperor of Mankind using advanced genetic engineering techniques. Each Primarch was designed to embody specific traits and abilities, making them superhuman in every sense. However, during their creation, the forces of Chaos intervened, scattering the Primarchs across the galaxy. Despite this setback, the Emperor eventually found and reunited with each of his sons, who would go on to lead the Space Marine Legions during the Great Crusade.</p>
    <p>There are currently 18 known Primarchs, each representing a different aspect of the Emperor's vision for humanity's future.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lion El'Johnson - Primarch of the Dark Angels</li>
      <li>Fulgrim - Primarch of the Emperor's Children</li>
      <li>Perturabo - Primarch of the Iron Warriors</li>
      <li>Jaghatai Khan - Primarch of the White Scars</li>
      <li>Leman Russ - Primarch of the Space Wolves</li>
      <li>Rogal Dorn - Primarch of the Imperial Fists</li> 
      <li>Konrad Curze - Primarch of the Night Lords</li>
      <li>Sanguinius - Primarch of the Blood Angels</li>
      <li>Ferrus Manus - Primarch of the Iron Hands</li>
      <li>Angron - Primarch of the World Eaters</li>
      <li>Roboute Guilliman - Primarch of the Ultramarines</li>
      <li>Mortarion - Primarch of the Death Guard</li>
      <li>Magnus the Red - Primarch of the Thousand Sons</li>
      <li>Horus Lupercal - Primarch of the Luna Wolves (later Sons of Horus)</li>
      <li>Lorgar Aurelian - Primarch of the Word Bearers</li>
      <li>Vulkan - Primarch of the Salamanders</li>
      <li>Corus Corax - Primarch of the Raven Guard</li>
      <li>Alpharius Omegon - Primarch(s) of the Alpha Legion</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Not all of these Primarch stayed loyal to the Imperium of Mankind. Some were corrupted by Chaos, while others were lost to the void of space. The Emperor's vision for humanity's future was ultimately shattered by the betrayal of his own sons.</p>
